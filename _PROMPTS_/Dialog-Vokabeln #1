Vokalbel- Dialog - Flipcard




Which version of the app should I create the flashcard component for?
1/3

Static HTML App (/web/) - Pure vanilla JS (Recommended)
Create standalone HTML/CSS/JS files in the /web/ folder. No build step, works immediately, can be served with 'npm run dev:static'. Perfect for your requirements of pure vanilla code.
1

Next.js React App (/src/) - TypeScript/React
Create a React component in /src/components/learning/. Integrates with existing Supabase, auth, and dashboard. Requires converting to React/TypeScript but production-ready.
2

Both - Create standalone first, then React version
Start with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for quick iteration, then convert to React component. Best of both worlds but takes longer.
3

Completely standalone - New separate files
Create independent index.html, style.css, script.js files outside the project structure. Can be opened directly in browser without any server.
